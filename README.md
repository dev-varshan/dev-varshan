## About Me

I’m Manoj Varshan, a third-year B.Tech Cyber Security student who strongly believes that building impactful solutions doesn’t always require coding — with the right tools, automation, and ideas, anything is possible.  That’s where I excel — blending smart tools with creative thinking to turn ideas into reality.

I'm:
-  **Broad-minded** – Open to working across any domain or technology.
-  **AI-savvy** – Skilled in using AI tools and crafting smart prompts to build intelligent workflows.
-  **Tech-adaptive** – I can quickly pick up any new stack or system and work efficiently.
-  **Multi-domain Explorer** – Actively involved in cybersecurity, web development, cloud, and AI automation.

I aim to **build meaningful tech** — from making student lives easier to protecting users online — all with a smart and practical approach.
